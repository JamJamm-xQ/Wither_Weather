# wither_weather

A weather app Based on London App Brewery's "Clima".

My First Major Git/Git Hub project!

In this project, I learned about Futures, async and await, what JSON files are and how they are used to make API calls, how to create TextField and transport information between pages and also import flutter packages.

***Had to create twin "uiUpdate" functions to make parallel API calls to OpenWeather Maps to handle weatherData from both user location and city entry.***

'Twas fun!
